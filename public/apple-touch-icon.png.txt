PLACEHOLDER: Apple Touch Icon (180x180px)

To create this file:
1. Use the favicon.svg as a base
2. Export it as a 180x180px PNG with:
   - Background: #0A0A0A (Deep Obsidian)
   - Logo centered with appropriate padding
3. Save as apple-touch-icon.png

For now, the SVG favicon will serve as a fallback.
