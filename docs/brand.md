# 🎯 BLACK ARROW TECHNOLOGIES - BRAND GUIDELINES

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-27
**Tagline:** *Precision. Performance. Profit.*

---

## 🧠 BRAND ESSENCE

Black Arrow Technologies is **not another web agency**. We are a precision-engineered digital weapons system for businesses ready to dominate their markets. Every line of code, every pixel, every campaign is engineered for one outcome: **measurable revenue growth**.

**Brand Personality:**
- **Sharp:** Like a surgical strike, not a scattergun
- **Confident:** We know what works (147 projects prove it)
- **No-Nonsense:** Zero fluff, all signal
- **Intelligent:** AI-native, data-driven, future-focused

**NOT:**
- Corporate (no "synergy" or "innovative solutions")
- Playful (no emojis in copy unless tactical)
- Apologetic (no "we might" or "we hope")
- Generic (no "best-in-class" without proof)

---

## 🎨 VISUAL IDENTITY

### Logo
- **Primary:** Wordmark "BLACK ARROW TECHNOLOGIES" in Unbounded Bold
- **Symbol:** Abstract arrow icon (geometric, minimal, 45° angle)
- **Colors:** Cloud Dancer text on Deep Obsidian background
- **Clear Space:** Minimum 40px padding around logo

### Color Psychology
| Color | Hex Code | Usage | Emotion |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|
| **Deep Obsidian** | `#0A0A0A` | Backgrounds | Premium, serious, focused |
| **Cloud Dancer** | `#F0EEE9` | Body text | Clarity, readability, trust |
| **Warm Sand** | `#C9A46B` | CTAs, accents | Confidence, warmth, action |
| **Slate UI** | `#2B2F36` | Borders, cards | Structure, professionalism |

**Rule:** Warm Sand is ONLY for CTAs and hover states. Overuse kills its power.

### Typography Rules
| Element | Font | Size | Weight | Color | Use Case |
|---------|------|------|--------|-------|----------|
| **H1 Hero** | Unbounded | 56px | Bold | Cloud Dancer | Homepage hero only |
| **H2 Section** | Unbounded | 40px | Bold | Cloud Dancer | Section headers |
| **H3 Card** | Unbounded | 24px | Bold | Cloud Dancer | Service cards, case studies |
| **Body** | Hanken Grotesk | 16px | Regular | Cloud Dancer 80% opacity | Paragraphs |
| **CTA Button** | Hanken Grotesk | 16px | Bold | Deep Obsidian (on Sand BG) | Primary actions |
| **Caption** | Hanken Grotesk | 14px | Regular | Cloud Dancer 60% opacity | Metadata, dates |

### Iconography
- **Library:** Lucide React
- **Stroke Width:** 2px (consistent, never 1px or 3px)
- **Color:** White (`#F0EEE9`)
- **Style:** Flat (no gradients or shadows)
- **Size:** 24px for cards, 48px for hero sections

## ✍️ TONE OF VOICE

### Core Principles
1. **Direct:** Say it in 10 words, not 20.
2. **Active:** "We build" not "We can help you build."
3. **Proof-Driven:** "89% retention" beats "high satisfaction."
4. **Human:** Write like a smart consultant, not a robot.

### Bad vs. Good Copy Examples

| ❌ Bad (Generic) | ✅ Good (BAT Voice) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "We provide innovative web solutions." | "We build eCommerce platforms that convert 35% higher." |
| "Our team is passionate about helping you succeed." | "147 projects. 89% stay for Year 2. We deliver." |
| "Let's discuss your needs!" | "Start Your AI Audit" |
| "We leverage cutting-edge AI technologies." | "AI recommendations. Real revenue. No guesswork." |
| "Trusted by leading companies." | "₹2.3Cr revenue unlocked for luxury watch retailer." |
